Kindle_Store_5,0.076640647,OR,"Just a heads up, if you have read other timeless romance anthologies, then you may have read some of these stories before. Five of the six are found in other anthologies. Regardless, some of the stories are definitely worth another read.
I didn't particularly like the first story, Our Song Cassie was a bit too whinny for me, but that was more personal preference than a reflection on the story. War of Hearts also felt a little contrived, but I am sure there are those that would disagree.
I did enjoy Between the Lines. The romance was so cute and I couldn't help but root for Thomas to work out his mix up. I also loved William and his concern for Claire in A Taste of Home.   Both these stories had swoon worthy endings left you rooting for happily ever afters.
All in all a collection of great stories and definitely worth the read especially if you are new to Timeless Romance Anthologies."

I have heard that the game is very similar to the one I played. The Clue is a great way to get familiar with the concept of the game. It has all the different pieces that you can see in the game and you can play with a group of people. The game is played by a group of people, but the game is about a group of people playing a game. It is more like a group of people playing a game. The game is fairly simple, but the basic rules are simple enough for you to understand. I think it is a good game to play with the group of people who are going to play. You can't really mess things up with the people who are going to play with you, but the people who are going to play with you will get bored of it very quickly. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good game to play with friends or family. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a game that is not going to get bored with the game at first. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.

I kept thinking, during the first 30 or 40 pages, this thing just isn't going anywhere, but it was getting such darned good reviews on Amazon.... So I pressed ahead. It's worth the effort, although the racial and cultural language was.... well, probably unintentionally demeaning. The story really takes off after a bit and becomes a neat roller coaster ride. The first person / third person  transitions weren't bad, and it was good to actually be able to follow what happens to the other characters. Worked for me. It's entertainment. Good setup for a sequel or two. There are some great characters in the book- ""Sarge"" and Thad being particular favorites. ""Going Home"" is well worth the money."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0.78622697,OR,"I purchased the Paula Deen steamer as a replacement for a Cuisinart steamer so I'll be comparing it to that.  Overall, the PD unit is pretty well made.  It's lightweight, but not thin walled.  The steamer fits very snug to the pot and does an admirable job letting condensed water seep through the holes.  I thought it did a better job of this then the Cuisinart unit.  This is probably due to the slightly larger steamer holes in this unit.

What I love most about this steamer is the rubber like wrapping of the handles and lid.  This keeps both the steamer and the lid cool enough to handle even when the pot has been boiling for a long time.  The Cuisinart did not have this and it's definitely a plus!  What's also better in the PD steamer is its resistance to staining; cleaning up is pretty easy.

What I don't like is what keeps this unit from getting 5 stars; the design of the base.  The base has a concave design, that is it's flat on the outside, but the metal depresses in towards the middle.  Why is that a problem?  Because this means the bottom doesn't get full contact with the ceramic stovetop that I use which means I spend more time waiting for water to boil, alot more time then the Cuisinart.  The PD unit has a copper plated bottom, which should mean a faster and more efficient heat transfer, but there's just not enough of the metal to make contact.  If you're using a gas stove, then this is irrelevant.  I'm guessing it was designed this way to save money by cutting material costs, but it will end up costing me more in the long run with a higher electric bill.  I would have gladly paid $5 more if the bottom were flat.

Overall I am happy with the purchase and would buy it again if I had to."

Movies_and_TV_5,0.428880888,OR,"It's been a while since we've had a movie where a child played the bad guy, or in this case, the bad girl. This movie really exceeded my expectations as I was expecting another predictable and corny horror flick. ""Orphan"" is billed as a horror movie, but in actuality it is a psychological thriller. Any way you slice it (no pun intended), this turned out to be a very good movie.

The first thing that comes to mind while watching this movie is ""The Good Son"" (1993), but ""Orphan"" has a better plot, more twists & turns, a more deranged child, and more surprises than you'd expect. Actually, Esther (the Orphan) is so evil and mentally disturbed that she makes ""The Good Son"" seem like a choir boy. Like other movies with this theme, the mother becomes suspicious early-on that something isn't quite right about the child, while the father plays the head-in-the-sand do-do who just doesn't get it until it's too late.

This flick is not about the supernatural or demons and such; it's just about one conniving, creepy, crazy a** kid who was adopted from an orphanage and who terrorized the hell out of a somewhat ordinary family struggling to overcome some tragic life events. This is one of those movies that you can't say too much about without giving away the entire plot, but I can say that ""Orphan"" is quite entertaining and is definitely worth seeing. It has great acting, a good plot, a great lead character, a little humor, numerous twists & turns, good suspense and a surprise ending. In fact, I'm anticipating a possible ""Orphan II""."

First thing you need to know that none of the guys are Oscar Nominated actors (Dolph Lundgren, Vinnie Jones, Randy Couture) so every film that they star in is about action. But I must admit that they did a surprisingly good acting job in this one. Also a surprise is the shocking depth of  this storyline. Don't get me wrong the plot is not fantastic by any stretch of the imagination but it is 10 times better than the usual plot which either of these actors stars in. The action sequences are fairly well done but this is not your standard shoot em up film. This is more about the inner workings of why all sides of the drug trade do what they do and how their choices effect their family and friends."

Movies_and_TV_5,0.865427474,OR,"While this film ostensibly is based on an American novel, its plot and themes seem stolen from ""Martin Fierro,""  a 19th century Argentine epic gaucho poem.  There are plenty of beautiful landscapes and scenes of stampeding cattle to keep you visually entertained---in addition to pretty Gene Tierney and hubba-hubba-hubba Rory Calhoun.  Both wander around through part of the film with strategically torn tops that chastely communicate ""come hither.""  Calhoun is wooden as befits his role, and Tierney just sits, stands, and faints throughout the film, looking Gene Tierneyesque but not having much to do. Hugh Marlowe of ""All About Eve"" fame offers a lot of platitudinous talk of ""progress"", of the end of the barbarous life of the gauchos when confronted by the forces of the city (i.e.civilization).  This is a motif of Argentine history and a standard of Western fare.  See the flick and chalk if off as a Western set in the Southern Hemisphere."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0.993967231,OR,"This is my second Stuhrling watch.  I also own a women's original, which looks a bit more rich.  This model looks good with the advantage that the blue hands make it much more functional. The color provides a contrast making it much easier to read the time than on my original.  This model comes with two bands, one black, one brown.  Since my original came with black, I had my husband change the band to the brown.  No special tools were necessary, though it was a little tricky to line up the holes, so I don't think it would be convenient to change the band often.  Stuhrling watches keep very good time with the advantage of not having to change batteries.  You do have to set the time if you haven't worn it in a few days, but the auto wind feature works great and the ability to see the working mechanism from the front and back of the watch is cool."
Pet_Supplies_5,0.1250604,OR,"My dog has arthritis and Cushing disease, so she takes several medications three times each day.  Pill pocket flavor matters big time here, making the difference between her swallowing meds eagerly versus engaging in repeated  wrestling matches to gag the same pills down her.  My dog occasionally will eat the chicken flavor -- for one pill only.  She spits subsequent doses out right away -- or she picks at the pocket but leaves the pill behind, which puts us back to the wrestling routine.  I have much more consistent success with getting her to swallow meds eagerly if I consistently use the pea/duck flavor Pill Pockets.  Personally, I think those smell like rotten who knows what, but she loves the pea/duck flavor, and that's what matters.  It's a no brainer at my house; I've learned to put the pea/duck version on rotating order and hold my nose."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0.765537605,OR,"This makes a truly excellent cup of coffee or espresso - for one person. Probably you can't make a better cup given a particular roast of bean.  I just think it should be bigger.  We like strong coffee and a nice big cup of it. We make two big cups of coffee and we basically have to repeat the whole process twice. And if you have more people, well, I have other things to do with my day, just get out the old dripper I guess. If they made one twice as big I think it would be a huge improvement.

The key insight of this coffee maker is to use lots of coffee, let it soak in the water, and above all, do NOT get the water so hot. 160 or 170 degrees - you won't get the bitterness and off tastes as with hotter water. Now, using this insight, I have been able to use a drip basket instead of the Aeropress in a pinch, and get about the same quality a beverage. A lot of filter baskets taken out of drip machines have a little valve on the bottom so the coffee only drips out when a coffee pot is underneath. You can just put the filter and coffee and the not-too-hot water into this filter basket, and wait a couple minutes, then release the valve and let the coffee drain into a cup. Same quality as you get with an Aeropress, and it just proves that the not-too-hot water soak method is the key.

Frankly as they are not making a bigger model of this I think I will get a French Press. Use not-so-hot water, and make as much coffee as you need without going through the motions 2, 3, 4 times. I think the only problem with that is that a French Press does not have as fine a filter as the Aeropress and you will need to use a coarser grind of coffee or end up with a lot more sediment in your cup."

I suppose there is a possibility that Simpson did confess. It simply seems to me that given that the author admits to having made up stories about Simpson in the past, the credibility of this interview is questionable. The book is well written, and for that , I'll give it 3 stars. I'm sorry I couldn't give it more, and I don't necessarily believe that Simpson is innocent.

The brushed tungsten is darker than what the product photo shows, but still an attractive ring. My fiance' bought this as my wedding ring since we are on a budget, but again, it's very quality material & I'm very content with this purchase 

My ring finger was fitted as a 14 at some Jewelry Stores. I even had the chance to handle all the ring size rings myself to check it out, to find that perfect fit. 14 seemed to do the job. This ring does fit a tad bigger than what I was fitted for, so I would suggest you go down .5 of a size to ensure perfect fit. It's summer time here in Ohio & our fingers swell up in warmer weather, so the ring is secure enough not to fall off for now. But as soon as fall & winter arrive, I know I will have to purchase a 13.5 in a couple months so I can wear a ring in colder weather. But that's okay however, since the ring only cost the low price of $24, it won't even be an issue!

I hope my review helps someone in their decision making? There were other reviews specifically talking about the size offness, & with my confirmation, they were correct. Just buy one a half size smaller to match true fit!

God bless you all & may peace be upon you! I humbly ask for your prayers as I'm entering into Holy Matrimony here in 3 more days for a peaceful marriage, life longevity & happiness 

P.S.

The reason I gave it only 4 Stars was due to the fact the brushed Tungsten is darker than the picture shows & the half size differ that I & many others are talking about"

I am not one to get attached to my underwear, but these are the most comfortable I have owned in all my 63 yrs. of life. If I can, I will replace all my underwear with these.

Pet_Supplies_5,0.175550671,OR,"It's ironic as I bought this ""cheap"" harness because my puppy managed to chew his way through four very expensive harnesses in two weeks. In frustration I purchased this harness and viola - no more Houdini. There is a grommet on the back of the harness that you can tighten to hold the harness securely in place. No matter what size your dog is, the harness will most likely will fit snugly at all parts of the body (neck, legs, chest) which is exactly what you want. I also like the furry underarm straps so it doesn't rub the fur off his armpits when we're walking. And it's nice that there aren't any ""snapping"" parts to accidentally get his fur or skin caught in. You just slide it over his snout and then put his front arms through the straps. In fact, it's the fastest harness to put on when we have to take him out for a quick tinkle (we don't trust him on just a collar with his strong prey drive). The only downside with this harness is that since our dog is a very strong puller, he still pulls against you when walking. He doesn't choke himself though which is nice. I would recommend that a front clipping harness is better for walking when your dog is a strong puller, but this harness is great if you are tethering him, putting him in a dog seat belt in the car, or taking him out for a quick break (and it's the best fitting harness we've ever found for our growing boy)."

None of our cats bat an eye before chowing down when they see it sprinkled over their food, so it must taste pretty good to them.

With this latest box that we ordered we noticed that nearly half of the packs were not properly filled and contained much less Fortiflora than they should have, but within 2 hours of bringing it to the seller's attention they agreed to send us a replacement box from a different batch so I didn't let that affect my rating of the product since it has worked so well for us.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0.196999754,OR,"I'm a huge fan of the Saucony Jazz sneaker. They're not the most durable, nor are they particularly good for exercise or whatever. They're comfortable, though, and will serve as a basic fitness shoe. Moreover, they are fashionable. They always look classy, and this is a style that I don't think will ever really go out of style.

The best part is that they're priced in such a way that I don't feel terrible about replacing them once a year. I blow through a pair of these in about a year, but Amazon usually has one or more colors of them available for a really reasonable price point. This time I went with an all-black style, but I also have some green ones. It's a lot like wearing the converse all stars, but you get a lot more support for your foot. You can buy a bunch of these in different colors, if you want to have fashionable colorful sneakers but you don't want to develop foot and back pain.

And let's face it, by the way -- if you're walking around all the time, doing errands and exercise, and all that sort of thing, most sneakers are going to wear out pretty quickly. At least these are lightweight, comfortable, and fashionable -- and they don't break the bank!"

Electronics_5,0.101823532,OR,"What! Why would I want to make my Windows laptop a Chromebook. It's for my 10 year-old daughter. I got tired of rescuing her from the PC whenever she ended up somewhere no child should be in the Windows OS like the control panel or fiddling with files in Windows Explorer.

The USB drive is big enough to house the entire Chrome OS on it with enough room for wallpapers and such and its bootable. It is small and hardly noticeable which allows the notebook to still feel portable without removing the drive. Great product, amazing price."

Kindle_Store_5,0.784037653,OR,"OMG!!!! I don't know when I've ever laughed so hard. This book is amazing. I've been depressed the last few weeks, but I've spent this entire day laughing out loud like a lunatic. The antics Anne gets up to are hilarious. She is such a charismatic person that people just generate to her warm, bubbly personality. She is the center of attention anywhere she goes. The people that know Miss Welch in person are truly lucky indeed. I'm glad to say that I'm among those lucky people.
From this hilarious novella, I've learned how to use duct tape correctly, train my houseboys (if I ever get any) and how to be a great stalker. The lessons you can learn from her are endless. This is a book that I'll read more than once. Not just for the infinite laughter, but also for the things I can learn. Great work Anne Welch!!!! I'm so freaking proud of you."
Toys_and_Games_5,0.991991675,OR,"After the problems with the rights for the 1966 Batman TV show were fixed, they finally released an action figure series.  I have been waiting for a figure of this Batman for decades.  Now I finally have one in my hands, and I'm unmistakably pleased (but not in a filthy way, just pleased).

Before everything, as usual, ignore the first production picture and just go straight for the pictures of the figure in the box, or the customer images if you want to know what the figure really looks like.  I'll give you a hint: it looks amazing.  The detail is wonderful.  Not only they perfectly captured the look of the series, but the figure has very good articulation too.  And while it's almost invisible in the pictures, the utility belt has the classic bat emblem too.

Like all the other ones in the series, it comes with a stand and a collectible card, with some artwork of Batman on the front and part of a Batcave wide image in the back, which is completed with the other cards.  The figure is perfectly able to stand on its own, since the feet are large enough and the cape is thankfully made out of light fabric rather than heavy plastic.

Like the other figures, this one has no accesories.  Which is kind of a shame, since Batman had a lot of crazy gadgets in the old series.  I'd have gladly paid double if the figure had come with a small can of Shark-Repelent spray.  No matter.  The figure on its own is a great accomplishment and it's very well crafted, so it's worth 5 stars."

Not only is it fun for my son, but it's been fun for  us adults to play with too!  Some assembly required, but that was half the fun  ;)"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0.692464069,OR,"Ignoring common sense and warnings on the Web, I bought one of these hand held Dyson DC34 vacuums for about 4 times what I'd pay for a high end competitor's model (e.g. Black and Decker LiIon model). When I got it, I was initially very pleased: Good suction, worked very well. The battery life is short (maybe 6-7 minutes on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package.

Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it for a few seconds, have it stop, play games with the unit, get it to run for maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play more games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minutes out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously for more than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a horribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit was out of its (short) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one.

That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, has design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, or similar model for a quarter of the price. It might not be 100% as good as a vacuum, but it's assuredly 90% as good, and in addition, you'll get a much longer lifetime out of it. And when it dies, you can buy another THREE before you're up to the cost of this piece of poorly designed junk.

I was burned. You don't have to be."

Electronics_5,0.746054438,OR,Works well after several sensitivity adjustments to eliminate false alarms in my particular environment. The sound is realistic enough when heard behind a closed door. In my estimation it will take a very perceptive burglar to determine that it is not a real dog behind the door. In terms of construction quality relative to the price I would rate it on the cheap side and that is why I am taking off one star. I have it connected to power via a WeMo switch and it turns on when i leave home and off when I return. This works only if no batteries are installed.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0.655428331,OR,"OK...I have been carrying every known backpack since 1976 when I joined the Army, Rangers and Special Forces.  I was skeptical of buying a Badlands backpack...I've never had a backpack this small (compared to a SOF CFP-90, Dana, Mystery Ranch)  But this backpack is perfect for a bow hunter.  I have not purchased the Bow Boot...I will...but this is just big enough to carry everything I need to stalk into my tree, put up my stand and then pull out all my ""warmies"" and get comfortable for the days hunt.  The straps give you options to tie things on the backpack...even without the Bow Boot...I can safely secure my bow to the backpack.  I can even use the side straps...that have a weird configuration...but are perfect to strap the backpack to my Lone Wolf Alpha Tec or Lone Wolf Sit and Climb platform with shoulder straps on the frame and hike them both in.  I normally leave the stand and hunt it three days and then just backpack the pack in and out.  The pockets are innovative.  It took me a while to lay out all of my equipment and find a proper spot for them but I have been able to put in...Rattle and Roll Rattle, Deer Grunt Call, Binoculars, extra knife, knife sharpener, cleaning gloves, Laser Range Finder, Bottle to Drink, Bottle to get rid of Drink, Deer Camera, Tree Saw, Rain Jacket, Rain Paints, Vest, Sweater, Extra Cold Weather Gloves, Baseball hat, Tree Screw, 3D roll of fabric.

Books_5,0.835632121,OR,"It was a long time coming, this book, ""One Was a Soldier."" It downloaded to my Kindle and I dug in happily. I had to pace myself, as my inclination was to inhale it in one sitting. The story itself is something of a departure from the standard mystery format. The serious issues facing veterans returning from war take center stage for at least the first third of the book, and, after the actual mystery kicks in, Spencer-Fleming continues to pull this thread through to the end. The relationships among the characters that began in earlier novels in the series are brought forward and developed further. What I enjoy most about Spencer-Fleming's writing is the little touches, and the way her characters remain true to themselves. In this story, Clare is struggling with issues surrounding re-entry into her life as pastor in Miller's Kill. Some of the effects of the war in which she has just been engaged have changed her and altered her reality. She has the same issues as other soldiers who return from combat. But Clare is a priest, and donning her collar, along with all its attendant expectations, makes dealing with those issues that much more difficult. In her construction of the dialogue, the author makes Clare's very human struggle apparent and sympathetic.

Other writers here have reviewed the story in greater detail. A lot happens in ""One Was a Soldier."" There is significant progress in the story for all the characters, but there is plenty left on the bone for the future. I await the next installment in the series excitedly. Spencer-Fleming is a fine writer. Her novels never disappoint."
